Light up your jacket wusing sewable arduino microcontroller and LEDs.

Materials Required:

1 Jacket
10-12 Lilypad sewable LEDs - https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13902
1 Lilypad Arduino - https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12049
2 Lilypad push buttons - https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8776
conductive thread - https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10867
1 Lilypad battery holder - AMX3d LilyPad Power Supply
1 AAA battery
1 Microusb to USB cable

Sew the LEDs, push button and microcontroller on to the jacket as explained in https://github.com/rpattath/Lighted-Jacket/blob/master/IMG_7181.JPG

You can also have the arduino controller on seperate patch of cloth and use snap buttons to complete the circuit.

Once the circuit is complete, upload the code in https://github.com/rpattath/Lighted-Jacket/blob/master/Jacket.ino to the arduino controller.

This is how the jacket is expected to work:
Press and hold the button on the left sleeve for the LEDs on left side to blink
Press and hold the button on the right sleeve for the LEDs on right side to blink
